<ACLs> An access control scheme offering both confidentiality and integrity assurances.
The scheme is named after one of the data structures needed to implement. Access Control Lists.
<Additional Statement Attack> A flavor of SQL injection where the attacker is able to send additional statements
to the SQL interpreter other than the author anticipated.
<Adware> A program that serves advertisements and redirects web traffic in an effort to
influence user shopping behavior.
<Affected Users> One component of the D.R.E.A.D. system describing what percentage of likely
users would be vulnerable to a given attack.
<Agent> A presence on a system. An agent is also known as a digital identity, an online
persona, an account, or even a login. A system can represent an agent in a variety
of ways, from an account ID to ticket (a key representing a single session on the
system).
<Applicant> A principal who is seeking to be a subscriber. Note that the system policy may
preclude some applicants from becoming a subscriber. Most systems have a
mechanism for an applicant to become a subscriber
<ARC Injection> A type of memory injection vulnerability where the attacker alters the execution
of the program by overwriting a function pointer.
<Array Index Vulnerability> A form of memory injection where the attacker can achieve arbitrary memory
overwrite because an array index value is not properly validated.
<ASCII-Unicode Vulnerability> A type of memory injection where the attacker is able to overcome normal
bounds checking by exploiting a bug in the way the size of a buffer is computed.
<Asset> Something of value that a defender wishes to protect and the attacker wishes to
possess.
<Attack> A risk realized. In other words, a vulnerability exists in the system and an attacker
has exploited it.
<Attackerâ€™s Advantage> A collection of advantages that attackers have over defenders, including 1)
choosing the time of the attack, 2) choosing to attack the weakest point, 3) not
being bound by the law, and 4) choosing unknown attacks.
<Authentication> Authentication is the process of tying a subscriber to an agent. This occurs when
a claimant presents the system with credentials. The authentication system then
verifies the credentials, activates the corresponding agent, and gives the
subscriber the ability to control the agent.
<Authority Attack> A social engineering attack where on appears to hold a higher rank or influence than one actually possesses. 
<Availability> One of the three fundamental security assurances. The availability assurance is defined by U.S. law as "ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information. 
<Back Door> A mechanism allowing an individual to enter a system through an unintended and illicit avenue. 
<Bell La-Padula> An access control scheme offering confidentiality assurances.
<Biba> An acces control scheme offereing integrity assurances.
<Biometrics> A type of "who you are" authentication where the system takes a direct measurement from the user to determin authenticity. 
<Black Hat> Black hats are individuals who attempt to break the security of a system without legal permission. 
<Bomb> A program designed to deliver a malicious payload at a pre-specified time or event. 
<Botware> A program that controls a system from over a network. 
<Caesar Cipher> A simple substitution enryption algorithm where letters are shifted down the alphabet to produce ciphertext. 
<Canon> One component of the homograph problem, the canon is a unique name or symbol representing a homograph set. Another name for a canon is a canonical token. 
<Canonicalization Function> One component of the homograph problem, the canonicalization function is a function that returns a canon from a given encoding. 
<Chosen Plaintext Attack> A type of attack on an enryption key where the attacker Eve can both select the plaintext to feed into the algorithm and see the resulting ciphertext.
<C.I.A> The three assurances: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. In many ways C.I.A. defines computer security. 
<Ciphertext> Human-unreadable text that has been transformed by an encryption algorithm. Also known as a cryptogram. 
<Ciphertext Only Attack> A type of attack on an encryption key where the attacker Eve can only see the resulting ciphertext, not having access to the plaintext which generated the ciphertext. 
<Claimant> A principal claiming to be a member of the subscriber set. Before becoming a subscriber, the claimant's identity needs to be verified. 
<Codebook> A type of encryption method where each token in a plaintext message is translated into a a ciphertext based on a very large key.
